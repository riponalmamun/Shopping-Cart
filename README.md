# 🛒 Spring Boot Shopping-Cart Web App - Enterprise DevSecOps Project

# 🛠 DevSecOps Pipeline for Java-based Application (Shopping-Cart)


Designed and implemented an end-to-end DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins for a Spring Boot application, integrating stages from SCM to Kubernetes deployment.

Embedded security-first practices using tools like Gitleaks, Trivy, and OWASP Dependency-Check to ensure vulnerability-free code, dependencies, and container images.

Automated SonarQube static code analysis with Quality Gates enforcement to block deployments on code smell or low maintainability ratings.

Built and published versioned Docker images to Docker Hub, with artifact deployment to Nexus Repository, ensuring traceability and immutability.

Deployed the application to Kubernetes using dynamically templated manifests and envsubst, reflecting best practices in GitOps-style delivery.

This is a full-lifecycle DevSecOps pipeline for a Java-based microservice called Shopping-Cart. It demonstrates enterprise-grade implementation of Secure CI/CD using modern tools and practices. Built and orchestrated using Jenkins, the pipeline covers every stage from code checkout, static analysis, secrets scanning, dependency validation, image security, containerization, and Kubernetes deployment.

# ✅ Pipeline Stages Explained

🔹 1. Clean Workspace
Cleans previous workspace and local cache to avoid stale data.

🔹 2. Git Checkout
Clones the main branch from GitHub repo securely.

🔹 3. Gitleaks Secret Scan
Scans codebase for API keys, tokens, credentials before any build begins (shift-left security).

🔹 4. Compilation
Compiles code without running tests to speed up pipeline feedback loop.

🔹 5. Unit Testing
Runs JUnit tests. Can be extended to integrate with Jacoco/Surefire for coverage metrics.

🔹 6. TRIVY FS Scan
Performs filesystem scan of the source repo using Trivy to detect CVEs before build.

🔹 7. SonarQube Code Quality Scan
Runs full static analysis and enforces Quality Gates. Pipeline blocks on failure.

🔹 8. Build Application Artifact
Builds versioned JARs using maven versions:set for proper artifact traceability.

🔹 9. Publish to Nexus
Publishes signed and versioned artifacts to Nexus repository manager.

🔹 10. OWASP Dependency Check
Audits all Java dependencies for known vulnerabilities with CVSS scoring.

🔹 11. Docker Build & Push
Builds image using Alpine JDK base and pushes securely to Docker Hub with token auth.

🔹 12. Trivy Image Scan
Scans Docker image layers for vulnerabilities, licenses, and misconfigurations.

🔹 13. Docker Container Deployment
Deploys application on a Docker host using --restart unless-stopped and port binding.

🔹 14. Kubernetes Deployment
Uses templated YAML and envsubst to inject image tags dynamically. Applies config via kubectl apply.


# 🛡️ Security Best Practices

Secrets Detection (Gitleaks) before any build or deployment
Quality Gate Enforcement via SonarQube
SBOM & CVE Scan via OWASP Dependency Check + Trivy
Docker Hardening using Alpine base image and resource-limited containers
Immutable Artifacts versioned and published to Nexus
